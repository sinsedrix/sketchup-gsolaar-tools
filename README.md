# Welcome to SketchUp GSolaar Tools

A SketchUp Ruby Extension that provides an importer for GSolaar polyhedra and other solids.

## Installing

The latest and greatest (definitely still in beta) is available as an RBZ.
Download the file from this url:

https://github.com/sinsedrix/sketchup-gsolaar-tools/raw/master/sketchup-gsolaar-tools_0.1.rbz

Then inside SketchUp, select Preferences > Extensions > Install Extension and select the RBZ file you just downloaded. Voila! SketchUp installs the extension.
You'll find a new entry under File > Import... file format selector.
